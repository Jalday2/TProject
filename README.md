# TProject
Thalassa run with some python

This program runs thalassa using python and can run it multiple times depending on how many inputs you put inside the
text files inside the multpileInputs folder. It also converts the outputs in numpy arrays and exports them to excel

To get it running run 
git clone https://github.com/Jalday2/TProject.git/ TProject

then in that folder run this to get thalassa 
git clone https://gitlab.com/souvlaki/thalassa.git/ Thalassa

Then after you set up thalassa my program should be able to be run using python3 tMain.py or python3 speedTest.py
